We shop, we cook, we clean and we run errands. We help people get up, washed and dressed or ready for bed at night. We collect prescriptions and help you remember to take medication.<\/p>\n<p>We help you keep your house in order and your bills paid.<\/p>\n<p>We can sit in and read to you, watch a film or just chat if that&#8217;s what you prefer. We can take you out to the shops, the theatre or wherever takes your fancy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 tabindex=\"0\">Do you also provide care at night?<\/h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Yes, we&#8217;ll work out a care package with you that will meet your exact needs, whether that&#8217;s day care, night care or both.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 tabindex=\"0\">What if my needs change?<\/h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Not a problem at all. We&#8217;re completely flexible and happy to change your care arrangements at any time. For example, if you have family members coming back for the weekend and you don&#8217;t need us for a couple of days, you simply have to let us know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 tabindex=\"0\">Will I be able to afford it?<\/h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Because we&#8217;re a small, independent business without big overheads, our charges are very competitive.
